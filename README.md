# Probability Distributions with R

This repository contains R code for developing and analyzing probability distributions for both discrete and continuous variables.

## Distributions Included:

### 1. Binomial
The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success.

### 2. Cauchy
The Cauchy distribution is a continuous probability distribution used to represent variables that are symmetrically distributed around a median value.

### 3. Chi-square
The chi-square distribution is often used in hypothesis testing and represents the distribution of the sum of squared standard normal deviates.

### 4. Exponential
The exponential distribution models the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur continuously and independently at a constant rate.

### 5. F
The F distribution arises frequently as the null distribution of a test statistic, especially in the analysis of variance (ANOVA).

### 6. Gamma
The gamma distribution is a flexible distribution used to model continuous variables that are non-negative and have skewed distributions.

### 7. Geometric
The geometric distribution models the number of trials needed to achieve the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.

### 8. Hypergeometric
The hypergeometric distribution models the number of successes in a fixed-size sample drawn without replacement from a finite population.

### 9. Lognormal
The lognormal distribution is used to model data that are positively skewed and typically represents variables that are the product of many small independent factors.

### 10. Normal
The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most widely used distributions and describes many natural phenomena.

### 11. Poisson
The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.

### 12. Uniform
The uniform distribution is used to model continuous variables that are equally likely to take on any value within a specified range.

### 13. Beta
The beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions defined on the interval [0, 1] and is often used to model random variables limited to intervals of finite length.

## How They Work:
Each distribution in this repository comes with R code that demonstrates how to generate random variates, calculate probabilities, and visualize the distribution's characteristics using R's built-in functions and packages such as `stats` and `ggplot2`.
